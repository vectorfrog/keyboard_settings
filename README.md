# keyboard_settings

This repo simply stores my different keyboard settings.

Use the QmkToolbox to flash a hex file to your keyboard once you have entered the reset phase.  To trigger reset on my layouts, simultaneously press the outer most key on the top row, with the outermost key on the bottom row.
